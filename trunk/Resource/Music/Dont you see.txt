When I see your smile
I can't find the right words to tell you
It's like I'm writing a letter to a long-lost friend again
Always thought there's be more time
To hold you in my arms
And never let you go
I hope you never forget
The ones you care for need you
I know it all seems hopeless
Love is asking to be loved
Sometimes, I sit and think
That maybe giving up now would be much better
And put my mind at ease
Don't you see!
That even when you're gone, I pray
I get to see you one more day
I still worry about you
Don't you see!
I know the world keeps spinning round
Whenever you are feeling down
Hang on
I'll be there!
