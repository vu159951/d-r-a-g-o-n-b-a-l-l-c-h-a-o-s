Bit by bit, I’m falling under your spell
Your smile’s all I need to see to know we’ll
Leave this endless darkness, saying, “Come along with me!” Hold my hand

Back when you first came into my life,
I recalled a place that I knew as a child: a special place, one that I held close to my heart
Won’t you lead me in a dance down this winding road,
Where light and shadow entwine to take hold of the thoughts of the one left far behind?
Know that sometimes, I want to turn around and see the things that I’ve passed on the journey,
But know with love on my side, with courage and pride, I’ll fight; I will carry on

Bit by bit, I’m falling under your charm
You’ll keep me and all the world far from harm
Bring hope to everyone; take in your hands eternity
Even when it seems that I don’t need you,
Just know that I am in love; can’t wait to
Leave this endless darkness. Won’t you come along with me? Hold my hand
